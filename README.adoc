= Setup

You'll need a tigergaph cloud instance. Once you have that, you'll need to put your credentials in your `gradle-local.properties` file. Don't check this into your repository.

.gradle-local.properties
[source,properties]
----
gHost=josh-deforestation.i.tgcloud.io
gHostUriType=https
gAdminUserName=tigergraph
gAdminPassword=REDACTED
gUserName=tigergraph
gPassword=REDACTED
gCertPath=my-cert.txt
gClientVersion=v2_5_2
gSecret=REDACTED
----

You'll need to get your cert from your cloud instance.

.shell
....
openssl s_client -connect <tigergraphserver>:14240 < /dev/null 2> /dev/null | \
openssl x509 -text > my-cert.txt
....

Finally, you'll need to generatet a secret. Easiest way I know:

`gradle --console=plain gsqlShell`

Then
....
use graph deforestation
create secret
....

Copy the secret into your `gradle-local.properties` file.
